// The diffrence between let and var is that you can redclare var but can't redeclare let.
// You can also access a hoisted varable with var and let creates block scope.

// The diffrence bettween var and const is the same with as of let.

// The diffrence betwen let is const is that let can be reassigned but you cant redeclare const.

//Hoisting is the way Js complies code. Variables are hoisted to the top of the scope they are declared in.
// var can acces a varrables name and its undefined value before its used late on.
